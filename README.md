## Hello there!

My name is Sam! I'm currently studying character FX in BYU's computer science and animation program. I love hiking, mountains, and animals! I interned with the Pixar system's team summer 2025 in IT support. I'm currently an animation system adminstrator for BYU.

My current programming projects this semester are graphics and algorithm related python labs. I most recently completed a C++ datalog parser and a Java chess application, the latter features a client and server for peer-to-peer communication over WebSocket and data persistence with MySQL. These two recent projects as well as a handful of small ones are available below.
