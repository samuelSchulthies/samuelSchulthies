## Hello there!

My name is Sam! I'm currently studying character FX in BYU's computer science and animation program. My current project is coding a C++ datalog parser, but I have a few other projects to share. I have most recently completed a chess application in Java that features a client and server for peer-to-peer communication using WebSocket. Features data persistence with MySQL:
