## Hello there!

My name is Sam! I'm currently studying character FX in BYU's computer science and animation program. I love hiking, mountains, and foxes!

My current programming projects this semester are graphics and algorithm related python labs. I most recently completed a C++ datalog parser and Java a chess application, the later features a client and server for peer-to-peer communication over WebSocket and data persistence with MySQL. These two recent projects as well as a handful of small ones are available below:
