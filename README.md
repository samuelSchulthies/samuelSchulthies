## Hello there!

My name is Sam! I'm currently studying character FX in BYU's computer science and animation program. I love hiking, mountains, and animals! I interned with the Pixar system's team summer 2025 in IT support. I'm currently an animation system adminstrator for BYU. I'm specializing in Character FX and hope to go into CFX tooling, CFX production, or systems production support.

My current programming projects this semester are graphics and algorithm related python labs, which I can share after classes end. These include projects such as an algorithm to compute a convex hull, or using linear algebra matrices to create a 3D image with PyGame. I most recently completed a C++ datalog parser and a Java chess application, the latter features a client and server for peer-to-peer communication over WebSocket and data persistence with MySQL. These two recent projects as well as a handful of small ones are available below.

I also have done 3D work during my schooling and have touched every part of the animation pipeline, from concept to lighting/rendering. I especially enjoy simulation and character FX, of which I have some examples in my demo reel, such as cloth, fur, or MPM: https://vimeo.com/909264860
